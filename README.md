## What is credit card fraud
Credit card fraud is a wide-ranging term for theft and fraud committed using or involving a payment card,<br>
such as a credit card or debit card, as a fraudulent source of funds in a transaction. It is of importance<br>
to detect such fraud via some novel methods. Here we will apply several `machine learning algorithms` to make prediction.<br>
