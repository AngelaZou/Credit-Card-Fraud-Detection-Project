## What is credit card fraud
Credit card fraud is a wide-ranging term for theft and fraud committed using or involving a payment card,<br>
such as a credit card or debit card, as a fraudulent source of funds in a transaction. It is of importance<br>
to detect such fraud via some novel methods. Here we will apply several `machine learning algorithms` to make prediction.<br>

## Dataset
The datasets(https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud) contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. <br>

## Key Results
First I analyze the raw data via several data analysis technique.

I want test Logistic Regression on skewed data. I also apply cross validation for hyperparameter tuning<br>
